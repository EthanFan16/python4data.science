This repository contains my individual completed material during the learning of coursera specialization: Applied Data Science with Python. The code are formatted in *.py* or *.ipynb* files.

There are 5 courses included in this specialization: date processing with numpy and pandas, data visualization with matplotlib and searbon, machine learning with scikit-learn, text mining (nlp) with re and nltk, social network with networkx.The first three should be taken in order and prior to any other, but courses 4 and 5 can be taken in any order. I plan to omit 5 and only study the 1-4 because network is less useful to my study and work.
 
Some code may contain the file path info. If you need to run it in your personal device, please proofread the path at first.
